The Kanban Calendar is a business task planning app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It uses the Kanban method to help teams manage tasks visually, with features like drag-and-drop for moving tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." The front end, built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, offers an intuitive interface, while the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensures smooth data management, with tasks stored in a MongoDB database for persistence. This app enhances productivity and transparency in business workflows.
