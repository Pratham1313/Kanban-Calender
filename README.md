# Kanban Calendar

The **Kanban Calendar** is a business task planning app built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It uses the Kanban method to help teams manage tasks visually, featuring drag-and-drop functionality for moving tasks between "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." The front end is built with **React.js** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and intuitive interface. The backend, powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, ensures smooth data management with tasks stored in a **MongoDB** database for persistence. This app enhances productivity and transparency in business workflows.
